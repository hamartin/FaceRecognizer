# FaceRecognizer

Scripts to train a Tensorflow neural network to recognize faces and display the result in a virtual webcam to be used by other software like Teams, Zoom etc.

## Idea

The idea of this repository for me and maybe for others is to create "something" using a neural network from start to end which can be used for something
more than just seeing the result on your own screen after implementation.

The plan is to make scripts which will grab pictures of you or someone elses face, use those pictures to train a neural network to recognize that
face in picture frames grabbed from a webcam and then forward modified pictures to a virtual webcam that can be used by other software.
